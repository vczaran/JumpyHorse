# JumpyHorse

Jumpy Horse is an 8bit, retro style game in which the user navigates an equine avatar over obstacles of varying width and height. The speed and difficulty will gradually increase. Players will be able to unlock horses with special attributes based on progress (see Bonus Features). Score will increment with every jump. There are 100 jumps in total. Players who wish to mute the sound effects and in-game music may do so by toggling the mute button.

**Technologies, Libraries, APIs:**

Canvas API

Keyboard API

HTML

CSS

Webpack and Babel

npm

**Implementation Timeline:**

Friday & Weekend: Get Canvas set up and rendering background and horse object. Research how to animate background and horse with Canvas. If possible, begin to animate background and horse.

Monday: Get horse running and background moving if not done already. Start adding obstacles and researching collision logic and handling.

Tuesday: Add gravity functionality and jump controls. Finalize collision handling.

Wednesday: Add styling and music/sound effects.

Thursday Morning: Final touches, update ReadME.

**Bonus Features:**

Change in environment every 25 jumps - background, music, and obstacles will change accordingly. Default initial style will be a farm and will transition to spooky forest then city and finally beach. 

Horse styles willl be unlockable based on game progress - each will have different stats (such as increased jump height and/or speed). The final unlock, upon completion of the game, will be a pegasus that can fly over obstacles.
