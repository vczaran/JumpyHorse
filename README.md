# JumpyHorse

Jumpy Horse is an 8bit, retro style game in which the user navigates an equine avatar over obstacles of varying width and height. The speed and difficulty will gradually increase. Players will be able to unlock horses with special attributes based on progress (see Bonus Features). Score will increment with every jump. There are 100 jumps in total. Players who wish to mute the sound effects and in-game music may do so by toggling the mute button.
